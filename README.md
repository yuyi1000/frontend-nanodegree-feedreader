# Feed Reader Testing

This feed reader is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It uses Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON objects under the hook. I added four test suites: RSS Feeds - checking validity of each feed and its URL and name, The Menu - checking if the menu is hidden by default and shown by clicking on it, Initial Entities - checking if at least one item is within a feed container, and lastly, New Feed Selection - checking if content changes when a new feed comes.
